"wvdial umts-pin &"               sends the PIN, this unlocks the Modem

"wvdial umts &"                          starts the internet connection

"killall --signal INT  /usr/bin/wvdial"   stops the internet connection


if you want to use these commands, 
you have to start umts-panel -> Menu -> Preferences
first. That generates a working /etc/wvdial.conf.
